## Abstract
This proposal highlights the organizational structural update of the Marshall DAO to two-level DAO, The IoTeX DAO and sub DAOs. The IoTeX DAO will be a veIOTX governed DAO while each subDAO will have its own focus to boost ecosystem growth. 

This IIP proposes the formation of the DePIN DAO as the first subDAO under the IoTeX DAO. The proposal includes renaming the Marshall DAO to IoTeX DAO, outlining the structure and guidelines for subDAO formation, reward distribution, and related project listing, and establishing a new DePIN DAO to handle reward emissions for DePIN ecosystem growth. This initiative aims to enhance ecosystem growth and streamline the management and incentivization of ecosystem projects in emerging sectors like DePIN, DeFi, etc.

## Specification
### Part 1: DAO Structure and Guidelines
to be added
### Part 2: The First SubDAO - DePIN DAO Details
to be added

## Rationale
The formation of the DePIN DAO as a subDAO under IoTeX DAO is intended to provide a specialized focus on the DePIN sector, streamline baseline reward distribution for bootstraping the supply side of DePIN networks, and thus enhance IoTeX ecosystem growth. By establishing clear guidelines and integrating with existing IoTeX's modular platform, this proposal aims to foster technical integration, support emerging DePIN projects, and drive the overall advancement of the DePIN ecosystem.

## Impact
This proposal will positively impact the IoTeX community by:
- Encouraging Participation: Providing a structured and transparent mechanism for funding DePIN projects and receiving rewards from these DePIN projects.
- Driving Innovation: Supporting the development of cutting-edge DePIN technologies and initiatives.
- Improving Governance: Enhancing the governance framework with dedicated oversight for DePIN-specific activities.

## Backwards Compatibility
The introduction of the DePIN DAO will be compatible with existing IoTeX DAO structures and protocols, ensuring smooth integration and operational continuity.

## Security Considerations
Security measures will be implemented to protect the integrity of the DePIN DAO and ensure safe handling of reward distributions and project evaluations.
